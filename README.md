# Road Safety Analysis for Victoria (2000-2005)

## Project Overview
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of road accident data in Victoria from 2000 to 2005. My goal is to uncover underlying patterns, identify key risk factors, and provide informed recommendations to the Victorian Government to enhance road safety measures and reduce accident rates.

## Approach
### Data Preprocessing: 
I performed meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing on datasets detailing accidents, locations, and atmospheric conditions. This involved addressing missing values, standardizing data types, and pruning irrelevant data.
### Data Integration: 
Relevant datasets were merged to create a consolidated dataset for in-depth analysis.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
I explored the data to identify time-based patterns, geographical distribution, and condition specifics using Tableau to create interactive Dashboard. https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/thienhuong.nguyen/viz/VICRoadAccidentDashboard2000-2005/Story 

## Key Findings
### Demographic Analysis:
Males and young drivers are disproportionately involved in accidents, with higher fatality and serious injury rates among these groups.
### Temporal Trends: 
A noticeable decline in accidents over the years, with peaks on Fridays and Saturdays, indicating behavioral risk factors.
### Geographical Insights: 
High concentrations of accidents in metropolitan areas and specific LGAs.
### Accident Specifics: 
Vehicle collisions are the predominant type of accident, with cars being the most involved vehicle type.
### Environmental Factors: 
Low-light conditions without adequate street lighting lead to higher injury severity.

## Recommendations
### Intersection Safety: 
Implement safety measures at intersections, including better signage and intelligent traffic systems.
### Public Awareness: 
Launch targeted campaigns to educate on the dangers of distracted driving and promote defensive driving practices.
### Enforcement of Traffic Laws: 
Enhance enforcement of traffic laws, focusing on speed compliance and safe driving behaviors.
### Infrastructure Upgrades: 
Prioritize road maintenance and improve street lighting in areas with high accident rates.

## Further Analysis Suggestions
### Cluster Analysis: 
To identify hidden patterns by grouping similar accidents.
### Time-to-Event Analysis: 
To evaluate the response times of emergency services.
### Social and Economic Impact Study:
To assess how broader social factors influence accident rates and severity.

## Data Availability
The dataset spans from 2000 to 2005 and includes information on accident specifics, vehicle details, and demographic data of individuals involved.
